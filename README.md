# Logo-Generator-2.0

# Description 
In this project, we were to use node.js to create a logo using a SVG file. So in order to create this file we had to make sure to pass numerous test in order to create the file. My main struggle in this project making the test be successful, but after some pretty rigourus task. I was able to create the SVG file successfully.
